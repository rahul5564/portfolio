             when we are new to programming we always think which language is best to learn and  which one has more opportunities 
            .I choose js but why? cause we dont have a choice,javascript is dynamic lanuguage,Js is the coolest programming language. Unlike other languages JavaScript is a loosely typed language, so JavaScript compilers are unable to detect type
             errors.
           </p>
           <hr>
          <p>well other programming languages are strongly typed languages. But it turns out that strong typing does not eliminate errors and <br>
            the strong type erros are not the erros we worry about,And js is supported mostly in all of the browsers and used globally so i choose JavaScript!</p>

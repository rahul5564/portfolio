            <p>When we are new to programming we always wonder what's the best to learn? </p>
             I choose js cause we dont have a choice,javascript is dynamic lanuguage.Unlike other languages JavaScript is a loosely typed language, 
             well other programming languages are strongly typed languages. <br>
              But it turns out that strong typing does not eliminate errors and the strong type erros are not
               the erros we worry about,And js is supported mostly in all of the browsers and used globally so i choose JavaScript!
           </p>
           <p>What does <b>backward</b> & <b>forward</b> compatbility mean?</p>
           <p>Once something is valid as js,there will be no features changes.the code written in "1995" should will work somehow today.
               forward compatbility means that including a new addition to the language In program would not cause the program to break even 
               if it would run in older js engine.
           </p>
           <p>Each file is a <b>Program</b>?</p>
           <p>Since js treats files as programs,one file may fail and that will not necessarily prevent the next file from beign processed.</p>
      </ul>
